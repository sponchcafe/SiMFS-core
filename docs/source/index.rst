Welcome to SiMFS-Tk's documentation!
====================================

You found the documentation of **SiMFS-Tk** - the Single Molecule Flourescence
Simulation Toolkit. Check out what we have to offer in the next paragraphs or
jump right into the Quickstart. For a deepdive checkout the architecture and
api documentation. 

What is it?
------------

**SiMFS-Tk** is a collection of simple tools to simulate single molecule
fluorescence experiments. Each tool is a commandline program that is configured
by a single json file and reads and writes a set of plain binary input and
output files. By chaining together multiple tools (components), complex
experiments can be simulated. The modular architecture allows easy and quick
iteration of parameters, parallel execution of simulations as well as
inspection of intermediate results and interfacing to third party software.

The project is developed in portable C++11 and build with CMake. Although fully
functional on Linux, MacOS and Windows platforms, some features are not
available under Windows. For Windows users we recommend using Cygwin_.

What can it do?
---------------

The toolkit supports many different use cases from simple to complex. For
example, the diffusion component can be used on its own to generate a diffusion
trajectory of a single molecule governed by brownian motion and parametrized by
a diffusion coefficient.  

The photophysics component can be parametrized to simulate a static immobilized
fluorophore with arbitrary states, ranging from simple 3-state (S0, S1, T1) to
higher excited states including long-lived dark states and bleaching.

Combining diffusion with focus components and photophysics, simple FCS
experiments can be investigated, with independent excitation and detection
foci.

Joining it all together, diffusion experiments with complex photophysics,
excitation and detection patterns, as well as pulsed experiments and FRET are
possible.

Features
^^^^^^^^
- Free isotropic diffusion and immobilized settings
- Three different focus functions
    - 3D-Gaussian
    - Normalized flux pseudo-Gaussian
    - Ideal lens E-field function
- Independent excitation and detection foci
- Arbitrary pulse definition to model Âµs and ns ALEX, PIE, POE and other pulse shemes
- State based photophysics for flexible modeling of fluorophores
    - Lifetime interval simulation to bridge short (ps) and long (minutes) timescales
    - Complete output of events in the rate graph (e.g. ISC and RISC events)
    - Event system to react to external factors (molecule movement, laser power, FRET photons, collision with simulation box, ...) 
- Utilities for splitting, mixing and buffering photon timetags
- Highly parallel execution and low memroy usage due to pipeline design
   

Who is it for?
--------------

This toolkit is for everyone who wants to generate simulated single molecule
data to complement experimental data, test and benchmark analysis procedures or
for demonstrative purposes.
